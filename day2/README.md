## Function Overloading
Function overloading, or method overloading, is the ability to create multiple methods with the same name and same return type, but a different number of parameters or different parameter types.

## When to use function overloading
- Function name is same.
- Number of parameters are different in each overload.
- If number of parameters is same the their type must be different.
- All overloads must have same return type.
